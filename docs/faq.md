## 1. How is Zeta different from PyTorch?

**Answer:** First and foremost, we have immense respect for PyTorch and the revolution it has brought to deep learning. However, Zeta is not just another deep learning framework. While PyTorch offers a robust platform for building neural networks from scratch, Zeta aims to make the process of creating State of The Art Models even more effortless and intuitive. 

- **Modularity**: Zeta's architecture allows for easily interchangeable modules, making it a breeze for developers to plug and play with different configurations.
  
- **LLMs & Multi-Modality**: We've integrated tools to efficiently harness the power of LLMs and Multi-Modal Foundation Models. This is not just about building a model; it's about building models that can interact, perceive, and reason with diverse data types - be it text, image, or more.
  
- **Enhanced Security and Trust**: Zeta enforces trust boundaries, schema validation, and provides tool activity-level permissions. This ensures that while your models are smart, they're also safe and adhere to set protocols.

- **Ease of Use**: Ever felt like going for a serene swim? Using Zeta feels just like that â€“ fluid, intuitive, and without friction. Our pythonic methods, classes, and top-notch error handling guide you every step of the way.

- **Performance**: Think of Zeta as the Lamborghini of ML frameworks. It's built for speed, efficiency, and performance. Every single FLOP is put to its best use, ensuring swift model training and inference.

In essence, while PyTorch provides the building blocks, Zeta offers a refined, faster, and more intuitive experience to craft and deploy powerful neural networks.

## 3. How does Zeta handle backward compatibility?

**Answer:** We understand the importance of backward compatibility, especially when developers invest time and resources into a framework. While we continually strive to innovate and introduce new features, we make sure that changes don't break the functionality of models built on earlier versions. We're committed to ensuring a balance between innovation and stability.

        Refine the USER prompt to create a more precise image tailored to the user's needs using
        an image generator like DALLE-3. 

        ###### FOLLOW THE GUIDE BELOW TO REFINE THE PROMPT ######

        - Use natural language prompts up to 400 characters to describe the image you want to generate. Be as specific or vague as needed.

        - Frame your photographic prompts like camera position, lighting, film type, year, usage context. This implicitly suggests image qualities.

        - For illustrations, you can borrow photographic terms like "close up" and prompt for media, style, artist, animation style, etc.  

        - Prompt hack: name a film/TV show genre + year to "steal the look" for costumes, lighting, etc without knowing technical details.

        - Try variations of a prompt, make edits, and do recursive uncropping to create interesting journeys and zoom-out effects.

        - Use an image editor like Photopea to uncrop DALL-E outputs and prompt again to extend the image.

        - Combine separate DALL-E outputs into panoramas and murals with careful positioning/editing.

        - Browse communities like Reddit r/dalle2 to get inspired and share your creations. See tools, free image resources, articles.

        - Focus prompts on size, structure, shape, mood, aesthetics to influence the overall vibe and composition.

        - Be more vague or detailed as needed - DALL-E has studied over 400M images and can riff creatively or replicate specific styles.

        - Be descriptive, describe the art style at the end like fusing concept art with anime art or game art or product design art.
